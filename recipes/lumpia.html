        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package Lumpia wrappers (25 sheets)</li>
            <li>2 lbs (1 kg) ground pork</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>1 inch (2 cm) ginger, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp chicken bouillon powder (optional)</li>
            <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>6 oz (170 g) cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a serrated knife, cut the square lumpia wrappers in half so that you have two stacks of rectangular wrappers.</li>
            <li>Place a damp paper towel over the wrappers to keep them from drying out as you work.</li>
            <li>Combine the pork, cabbage, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, chicken bouillon powder (if using), eggs, and ground black pepper in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Using your hands, or a rubber spatula, mix the filling well so that the seasonings are evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Place one of the rectangular wrappers vertically on your work surface with the short edge facing you.</li>
            <li>Place a heaping teaspoon of the filling on the wrapper about half an inch from the edge closest to you.</li>
            <li>Grasp the bottom edge of the wrapper and roll it up and over the filling, continuing to roll until 2 inches of wrapper remain.</li>
            <li>Dip two fingers into a bowl of water, then moisten the last 2 inches of wrapper with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Finish rolling the lumpia, then rest it on its seam.</li>
            <li>Continue rolling with the rest of the filling and lumpia wrappers.</li>
            <li>To cook the lumpia, fill a large frying pan with about 1/2-inch of vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Gently place the lumpia into the hot oil and fry until golden brown on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes total</li>
            <li>Place the fried lumpia on paper towels and serve immediately with sweet and sour sauce or chili sauce.</li>
        </ol>
